## Design Principles

1. Appreciate that people make mistakes
2. Value people and make systems that work for them
3. Keep it simple
4. Modularize, break things down, use good organization, make it understandable
5. Automate as much as possible
6. Create a system that prevents people from making mistakes
7. But not in such a way to prevent them from getting things done
